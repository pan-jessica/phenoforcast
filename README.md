# PhenoForecast

This is a Shiny app that delivers our forecasts of the leafing and flowering phenology of four tree taxa that produces allergenic pollen. The website can be found [here](http://phenoobservers.ucsc.edu/phenoforecast/). Please leave comments and/or suggestions by opening an issue.

This is my master's project and I will be improving the webapp's scalablility and user experience. The original code to this webapp can be found [here](https://github.com/zhulab-ucsc/phenoforecast).
